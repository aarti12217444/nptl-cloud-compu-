1...Which statement(s) is (are) true about dew computing?

Correct Answer: d. Dew computing is a paradigm where on-premises computers provide functionality that is independent of cloud services and is also collaborative with cloud services.
Explanation: Dew computing emphasizes the interaction between cloud services and local systems, allowing local devices to function independently when needed but also collaborate with the cloud.


2...What are the different aspects of CPS (Cyber-Physical Systems)?

Correct Answer: c. Cyber, physical, computation, dynamics, communication, security, and safety.
Explanation: CPS involves multiple dimensions such as computation, physical interaction, communication, dynamics, safety, and security.


3....What is the benefit of 5G's ability to scale down in data rates, power, and mobility for IoT devices?

Correct Answer: b. It provides extremely lean and low-cost connectivity solutions.
Explanation: 5G’s ability to adjust data rates and power consumption enables low-cost solutions for IoT devices, which typically don’t require high-speed data but need efficient, affordable connectivity.


4...Fog-Edge computing leads to increased network congestion.

Correct Answer: b. False
Explanation: Fog-Edge computing reduces the burden on centralized data centers by processing data closer to the source, thus alleviating congestion rather than increasing it.


5...What is(are) the key feature(s) of Mobile Cloud computing for 5G networks?

Correct Answer: a. Sharing resources for mobile applications
Explanation: Mobile cloud computing enhances the ability to share and offload processing tasks from mobile devices to the cloud, improving performance and efficiency.


6....Mobility Analytics utilizes the cloud platform for computation and storage.

Correct Answer: A) True
Explanation: Mobility analytics leverages cloud computing to perform large-scale computations and store data, as mobility data needs significant processing power and storage capacity.


7....In which computing environment is latency fixed due to the location of application modules at the Area Gateway?

Correct Answer: a. Fog computing
Explanation: Fog computing operates closer to the source of data generation (e.g., local area networks), allowing for more predictable and lower latency.


8...Resource-constrained low-latency devices drive the need for

Correct Answer: a. Heterogeneous and distributed computing architectures
Explanation: Low-latency, resource-constrained devices require diverse (heterogeneous) and distributed architectures to handle varying workloads and minimize latency.


9...Customized wearable devices for collecting health parameters are the best examples of

Correct Answer: a. IoHT (Internet of Health Things)
Explanation: Wearable health devices are prime examples of the Internet of Health Things (IoHT), which focus on collecting and sharing health-related data.


10....The cyber-physical system involves transdisciplinary approaches, merging the theory of cybernetics, mechatronics, design, and process science.

Correct Answer: a. True
Explanation: Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) integrate several fields including cybernetics, mechatronics, design, and process science to create systems that interact with the physical world through computation.
