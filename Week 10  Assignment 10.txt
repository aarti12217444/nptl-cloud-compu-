1...Why is VM migration important in cloud computing environments?
  b) To efficiently distribute VM load across servers, allowing for system maintenance and operational efficiency.
 

2....What is the difference between cold (non-live) and hot (live) VM migration?
 a) Cold migration turns off the VM during migration, while hot migration keeps the VM running.


3....Which of the following approaches are commonly used in live VM migration?
  b) Pre-copy and Post-copy.
 

4....Which of the following is a primary concern during VM migration to ensure service continuity?
  b) Minimizing both downtime and total migration time, and avoiding unnecessary disruption of active services


5...Which phase of live VM migration involves suspending the execution of the VM at the source and copying the remaining dirty pages and CPU state to the destination?
  c) Stop-and-Copy Phase
 

6....What is the primary advantage of the post-copy live memory migration strategy?
  b) It ensures that memory pages are only copied on demand, potentially reducing unnecessary data transfer.
 

7....Which of the following is NOT a requirement for live VM migration?
  d) Data replication


8...In serial VM migration, what happens to the remaining VMs when the first VM enters the stop-and-copy phase?
  b) They are suspended to prevent memory dirtying
 

9....What is a key advantage of using containers in cloud computing?
  c) Containers package code and dependencies, allowing applications to run consistently across different environments
 

10....What is the main function of a Docker container image?
  b) To package an application along with its code, runtime, system tools, libraries, and settings
